Antique Celebrity Sounds Instruments

Antique Celebrity Sounds Instruments is a new shop in Humboldt providing quality musical instruments, music lessons, and instrument repair. 
They provide both beginners' level instruments and higher-level instruments; one can rent a beginner's level instrument, or purchase an instrument. 
Both group and individual lessons are available, typically weekly. Instruments can be left for repair or other service (such as cleaning, string replacement, etc.) 
They also hold monthly music receptions featuring local musicians where they use an antique or celebrity instrument voted on by customers. 
They also maintain a log of instruments donated by celebrities or fans.

Questions:
1: Is the customer a Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced Musician?

2: Did the customer rented or purchase the instrument.

3: What celebrity or fans have donated their instrument to the shop.

4: What service is being asked if left for a type of repair(cleaning, parts repair, fine tuning?)

3: Customers cannot rent, continue with lessons, or have their instrument serviced if there are overdue charges.

4: Customers can choose to pay only in Cash, Credit/Debit Card, or Rent, but they can also choose to mix and match (half Cash and half Credit Card as an example.)
